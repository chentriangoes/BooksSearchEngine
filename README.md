## üìã Description
This project is to create a book search engine with Apollo Server, React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. Every visitor to the book search engine can look up for books with titles containing the key word of their input. Users can also register their accounts to save books of their searched items as the list of books. Delete function is available for users to removed any saved item from the book list.
